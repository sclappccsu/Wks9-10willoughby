<h3> 2.) How libraries help students in the Internet Age:</h3>
	Libraries are helpful to students even in the ever changing world of technology. They can help students with research of any topic and find all kinds of new information. For example at CCSU, there is the databse resarch which has helped me in the past. This helps you to find information on your assignment using many kinds of articles. Here you can find out what books, newspaper articles, magazines or movies may have some helpful information.
    <p id="demo">Libraries are also keeping up with the technology changing, while still keeping all their old books around as well. A library is the perfect place because it can help you with many different situations. They have computers to use, but alos contain hard copies of everything.

They have more than just books, which is why they are still useful to students like us today.
